# matplotlib-challenge

###Description of the Project
For this project, I am acting as a senior data analyst for Pymaceuticals Inc, a pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer drugs. They have recently been testing potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma. My job is to go over their data from a recent study on the drugs' treatment effect on mice. I have been tasked to generate tables and figures to represent the outcome of these trials in a visual format.


###Languages and Libraries
Matplotlib, Pandas, and Python


Analysis and Discussion
